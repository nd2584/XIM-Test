## XIM-GSAPP-Main Repository
 
### Intro to GitHub

For the rest of the semester, we will be learning the structure of GitHub to document the projects. As a first step, please download create a Gitbut account [here](https://github.com/)
Each of you should decide what is the best GitHub working method that works best for you. You can download the GitHub App or you can work on the browser version. We can go over both if you want to explore your options. 

We will be exploring the following:
- Accessing the class GitHub Organization
- Downloading the Repository
- Working on text editor such as Atom
- Creating and previewing markdown files including:
    * Formatting
    * Adding images
    * Linking to files

During this workshop we will do our first pull request and post a "Hello World" MD file that has some formatting, an image and a linked grasshopper file. If there is not enough time in the workshop, it will part of the assignment for the week.
