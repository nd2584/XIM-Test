Low Density/ Outdoor eating space, outdoor performance


### Required inputs
Urban Population Density: High

Street Pattern: Organic, Radial

Public Space SQ.ft per households: 28

Street Width: 60


### Type Rules
1. If the building height is lower than 120ft, then it will become a low density type, model type will be outdoor performance and outdoor eating
2. If the building set between 120-200ft, then it will become a mid density type, model type will be green roof public space
3. If the building height is more than 200ft, then it will become a high density type, model type will be bar area and tower on podium.
### Use Type If:
1. Your team is interested in exploring how the street pattern and width that affect the public space size
2. Your team is interested in defining what is the comfortable public space and quantity the dimension of the comfortable public space
3. If your team want to further study the sunlight, traffic issues and public space for Post-COVID era.

### Not Recommended to Use Type If:
1. Have too much data that add up to this model type
2. The density of population is not defined
3. Not thought about change the street system
4. The height of the building is too low

### What to Know & Limitations
1. The model is complex and need to pay attention to the different public space changed during the calculation
2. This procedural type only supports in high population density urban area. The building height should be large than 250ft
3. Need to set a attraction point, otherwise the model will not running
